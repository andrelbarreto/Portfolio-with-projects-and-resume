This is a Portfolio showcasing skills built during the Northwestern University Coding Bootcamp. In it you will also find more information about myself and my goals within the industry.

This Portfolio Repository started with just a bio page built using HTML and CSS Bootstrap.
It allows interface with menu for more information in About me, to fill out contact forms under Contact, or to take a look at my Portfolio as it grew during the course of 6 months.

It is effectively the first assignment for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and was constantly updated.

# Portfolio-with-projects-and-resume
This new version of profile is still under work but contains link to updated linkedin, a resume, and links to projects in portfolio

The best Northwestern University Bootcamp projects and homework assignments will be found within this portfolio.

The first is a Portfolio showcasing my skills being built during the Coding Bootcamp. In it you will find links to my projects, as well as more information about myself and my goals within the industry.

This Portfolio Repository starts with a bio page built using HTML and CSS Bootstrap.
It allows interface with menu for more information in About me, to fill out contact forms under Contact, or to take a look at my portfolio as it grows during the course of the next few months.

It is effectively the first assignment for the Northwestern Coding Bootcamp and will constantly be updated. It now contains a portfolio with several projects linked to main page showcasing not only my skills in full stack web development but also how I apply my several years of expertise in Communications, Marketing and Digital Marketing to them.
